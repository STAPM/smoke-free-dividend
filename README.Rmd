## Computational environment

This repository was last updated on `r Sys.time()` and used the following computational environment and dependencies:

```{r}
#| cache: false

# which R packages and versions?
if ("devtools" %in% installed.packages()) devtools::session_info()
```

The current Git commit details are (currently a private repository):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# what commit is this file at? 
if ("git2r" %in% installed.packages() & git2r::in_repository(path = ".")) git2r::repository(here::here())  
```
