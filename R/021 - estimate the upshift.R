### The aim of this code is to calculate the upshift factor to match
### Toolkit expenditure info to HMRC duties

data <- readRDS(paste0(Dir[1],"/toolkit_clean.rds"))

## set prices and duties as they were at december 2018

#price_fm <- as.numeric(smkfreediv::price_cigs[year == 2018 & month == 12,"price"])


### Calculate the December 2018 price from the 2016 WAP for cigarettes obtained from the
### OECD/WHO spreadsheet, upshifting using the tobacco RPI from Dec 2016 - Dec 2018

price_inflator <- as.numeric(smkfreediv::cpi_tobacco[Year == 2018 & month == 12,"cpi"])/as.numeric(smkfreediv::cpi_tobacco[Year == 2016 & month == 12,"cpi"])
price_inflator <- as.numeric(smkfreediv::price_cigs[year == 2018 & month == 12,"price"])/as.numeric(smkfreediv::price_cigs[year == 2016 & month == 12,"price"])

price <- as.numeric(smkfreediv::price_cigs_oecd[country == "United Kingdom","price"]) * price_inflator
